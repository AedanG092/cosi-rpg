Currently still deciding on tinyTino or normal sized Tino. TinyTino is 14 by 22, normal sized Tino is 16 by 24. Walking animations for both have been added for inspection.
To assemble animation, match the png names and use numbers to order. You will notice that no frame 0 or 1 exists -- this is because all animations will begin on the default frame.
